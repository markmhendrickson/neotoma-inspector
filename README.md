# Neotoma Inspector

A React SPA for inspecting and managing all data stored in a Neotoma instance. Provides full-coverage UI for every Neotoma REST API endpoint: browsing entities, observations, sources, relationships, schemas, timeline events, and interpretations, with an interactive graph explorer and top-level dashboard analytics.

## Architecture: Bundled at `/inspector`

The Inspector is always bundled into the Neotoma server build and served at `/inspector` on the same origin. There is no separate deployment, no GitHub Pages, no external URL to configure. `npm run dev` in the parent repo and the Inspector is live at `localhost:3080/inspector`.

The build that ships in the npm tarball lives at `<neotoma-package>/dist/inspector` (and `/app/inspector` inside the Docker image). `VITE_PUBLIC_BASE_PATH=/inspector/` is set at build time; `VITE_NEOTOMA_API_URL` is intentionally left unset so the Inspector uses relative same-origin URLs at runtime.

## Quick Start

```bash
# Install dependencies
npm install

# Start inspector + matching Neotoma dev API
npm run dev

# Start inspector + matching Neotoma prod API
npm run dev -- --env prod

# Build for production
npm run build
```

Vite defaults to **`base: /inspector/`** when `VITE_PUBLIC_BASE_PATH` is unset, so the dev server is at **`http://localhost:5175/inspector/`** (port **5175** avoids clashing with the repo root marketing Vite dev server, which often runs on **5173**/**5174**). Override the dev port with **`VITE_INSPECTOR_DEV_PORT`** or **`INSPECTOR_DEV_PORT`**. Override `VITE_PUBLIC_BASE_PATH=/` for a root-hosted build.

## Configuration

`npm run dev` launches a Neotoma API automatically via the CLI and injects the matching default API URL:

- `npm run dev` -> `dev` environment -> `http://localhost:3080`
- `npm run dev -- --env prod` -> `prod` environment -> `http://localhost:3180`

During local development, the SPA talks to the API through the Vite proxy at `/api`, which avoids browser CORS issues while still targeting the matching Neotoma environment above.

You can still override the API URL via environment variable or the Settings page:

```bash
# .env or .env.local
VITE_NEOTOMA_ENV=dev
VITE_NEOTOMA_API_URL=http://localhost:3080
```

Saved API URLs and auth tokens are scoped per environment (`dev` / `prod`), so switching preserves separate connection settings.

## Sandbox mode & session handoff

On the hosted sandbox (`sandbox.neotoma.io`), the Inspector is served at `/inspector` on the same origin as the API. Ephemeral sessions are created via the landing page pack picker and handed off to the Inspector via a one-time code in the hash fragment:

1. **Sandbox handoff (default for visitors).** Users start at `sandbox.neotoma.io/`, pick a fixture pack (generic, empty, or a use case), and are redirected to `/inspector#session=<one_time_code>`.

   `src/lib/sandbox_session.ts` (`consumeSandboxSessionHandoff`) runs on boot, POSTs `/sandbox/session/redeem` (same-origin), stores the returned bearer via `setApiUrl` / `setAuthToken`, scrubs the hash, and reloads. The `SandboxBanner` then shows the active pack id + expiry countdown + Reset / End-session controls.

2. **Manual bearer (power users).** Paste an API base URL and bearer on **Settings**. While a redeemed sandbox session is active, these fields collapse under "Show advanced connection settings."

3. **Local dev proxy.** `npm run dev` still launches a local Neotoma and proxies `/api`; no handoff needed.

### Sandbox UI flag

`VITE_NEOTOMA_SANDBOX_UI=1` (or any live redeemed session) enables:

- A persistent `SandboxBanner` with pack + expiry countdown, AAuth tier, and Reset / End-session buttons when a session is active; the public weekly-reset notice + terms / abuse links otherwise.
- Destructive admin surfaces are hidden to match the server-side destructive-op gate.

See [docs/subsystems/sandbox_deployment.md](../docs/subsystems/sandbox_deployment.md) for the full sandbox architecture.

## API Coverage

Covers all endpoints from the Neotoma OpenAPI spec.

## Integration

This app is a git submodule of the main Neotoma repo:

```bash
git submodule add <repo-url> inspector
```
